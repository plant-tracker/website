		To keep your fern looking healthy and vibrant, make sure it's getting enough humidity. You can
		increase humidity by misting the plant regularly with water, placing a tray of water near the
		plant, or grouping it with other plants to create a mini greenhouse effect. If your fern's
		fronds start to turn brown or crisp, it's a sign that it's not getting enough moisture and
		humidity.
